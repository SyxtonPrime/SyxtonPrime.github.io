[<p align=center> Branches, quivers, and ideals for knot complements</p>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13768) <p align=center> with Tobias Ekholm, Sergei Gukov, Piotr Kucharski, Sunghyuk Park, Marko Stosic, Piotr Sulkowski</p>

We generalize the <strong>F<sub>K</sub></strong> invariant, i.e. <strong>Z</strong> for the complement of a knot <strong>K</strong> in the 3-sphere, the knots-quivers correspondence, and <strong>A</strong>-polynomials of knots, and find several interconnections between them. We associate an <strong>F<sub>K</sub></strong> invariant to any branch of the <strong>A</strong>-polynomial of <strong>K</strong> and we work out explicit expressions for several simple knots. We show that these <strong>F<sub>K</sub></strong> invariants can be written in the form of a quiver generating series, in analogy with the knots-quivers correspondence. We discuss various methods to obtain such quiver representations, among others using <strong>R</strong>-matrices. We generalize the quantum <strong>a</strong>-deformed <strong>A</strong>-polynomial to an ideal that contains the recursion relation in the group rank, i.e. in the parameter <strong>a</strong>, and describe its classical limit in terms of the Coulomb branch of a 3d-5d theory. We also provide <strong>t</strong>-deformed versions. Furthermore, we study how the quiver formulation for closed 3-manifolds obtained by surgery leads to the superpotential of 3d <strong>N=2</strong> theory <strong>T\[M3\]</strong> and to the data of the associated modular tensor category <strong>MTC\[M3\]</strong>. 

[<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Z</strong> at large N: from curve counts to quantum modularity</p>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13349)

(with Tobias Ekholm, Sergei Gukov, Piotr Kucharski, Sunghyuk Park, Piotr Sulkowski)

Reducing a 6d fivebrane theory on a 3-manifold <strong>Y</strong> gives a <strong>q</strong>-series 3-manifold invariant <strong>Z(Y)</strong>. We analyse the large-<strong>N</strong> behaviour of <strong>F<sub>K</sub> = Z(M<sub>K</sub>)</strong>, where <strong>M<sub>K</sub></strong> is the complement of a knot <strong>K</strong> in the 3-sphere, and explore the relationship between an <strong>a</strong>-deformed (<strong>a = q<sup>N</sup></strong>) version of FK and HOMFLY-PT polynomials. On the one hand, in combination with counts of holomorphic annuli on knot complements, this gives an enumerative interpretation of <strong>F<sub>K</sub></strong> in terms of counts of open holomorphic curves. On the other, it leads to closed form expressions for <strong>a</strong>-deformed <strong>F<sub>K</sub></strong> for (2,2p+1)-torus knots. They suggest a further <strong>t</strong>-deformation based on superpolynomials, which can be used to obtain a <strong>t</strong>-deformation of ADO polynomials, expected to be related to categorification. Moreover, studying how <strong>F<sub>K</sub></strong> transforms under natural geometric operations on <strong>K</strong> indicates relations to quantum modularity in a new setting. 

[<p style="text-align:center">Computing Modular Data for Pointed Fusion Categoies</p>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05060)

(with Scott Morrison)

A formula for the modular data of <strong>Z(Vec<sub>ω</sub>G)</strong> was given by Coste, Gannon and Ruelle in [arXiv:hep-th/0001158](arXiv:hep-th/0001158), but without an explicit proof for arbitrary 3-cocycles. This paper presents a derivation using the representation category of the quasi Hopf algebra D<sub>ω</sub>G. Further, we have written code to compute this modular data for many pairs of small finite groups and 3-cocycles. This code is optimised using Galois symmetries of the <strong>S</strong> and <strong>T</strong> matrices. We have posted a database of modular data for the Drinfeld center of every Morita equivalence class of pointed fusion categories of dimension less than 64.

The database of modular data can be found [here](https://tqft.net/web/research/students/AngusGruen/Modular_Data/).
