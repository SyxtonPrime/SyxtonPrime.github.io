[Computing Modular Data for Pointed Fusion Categoies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05060)

Abstract: A formula for the modular data of Z(Vec<sub>ω<\sub> G) was given by Coste, Gannon and Ruelle in [arXiv:hep-th/0001158](arXiv:hep-th/0001158), but without an explicit proof for arbitrary 3-cocycles. This paper presents a derivation using the representation category of the quasi Hopf algebra D<sub>ω<\sub> G. Further, we have written code to compute this modular data for many pairs of small finite groups and 3-cocycles. This code is optimised using Galois symmetries of the S and T matrices. We have posted a database of modular data for the Drinfeld center of every Morita equivalence class of pointed fusion categories of dimension less than 64.

The database of modular data can be found [here](https://tqft.net/web/research/students/AngusGruen/Modular_Data/).
