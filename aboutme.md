title: About me
---

I am a recent arrival to the US, coming to CalTech to pursue a PhD in mathematics.

My reasearch focuses primarily on quantum topology, which is an area of maths which applies techniques from physics to solve problems in low dimensional topology. In addition to my reasearch area I am generally interested in applications of mathematics such as Machine Learning, Topological Data Analysis and more. 

### How I came to be here

I was born on a sunny/stormy/cold/snowing night in Sydney in the middle of the 1990's.

I went to Alfred Deakin high school, named, as I'm sure you know, after Australia's second prime minister and completed year's 11 and 12 at Narrabundah College.

I completed an undergraduate degree with honours from the Australian National University in 2017, majoring in mathematics and minoring physics and computer science. My honours thesis received a university medal.
