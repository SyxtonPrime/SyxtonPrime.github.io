title: I'm Published!

I've been excited for the last couple of days due to the fact that I recently discovered that the work I completed in my hounours will be published as paper in the [Indiana University Mathematics Journal](https://www.iumj.indiana.edu/)!! I've been a little giddy so please excuse the mathematics below (And feel free to skip it).

I worked on a type of category known as a pointed fusion categories. These categories are well known to be classified by the pair of a group and a three cocycle and have close relations to mathematical physics. My work focused on the Drinfeld centre of these categories which also appear as the invariant of the circle in Dijkgraaf-Witten theory. These categories are known as modular tensor categories in part due to the fact that there is a powerful invariant of these categories known as the modular data which consists of a pair of categories (Which form a projective representation of the modular group). As part of my honours I created code to compute these invariant for all Drinfeld centres of pointed fusion categories. Using this code I created a database of this modular data for all pointed fusion categoris with dimension less than 64, this database can be found [here](https://tqft.net/web/research/students/AngusGruen/).
