excerpt: Late last year I raced my fist Half Ironman Triathlon in the beautiful town of Santa Cruz. This race consists of a 1.9km swim, a 90.1km bike ride and a 21.1km run. I had an awesome time and decided to write a recap for anyone who might be interested.

        <!-- <h1>Cellular Automatas</h1> -->
            <p> It had been a long summer of training. The plan to attempt a half iron man had been forged months earlier soon after a crew of us had done the Pasadena and LA Triathlons. I was easily convinced, it had been something I was interested in for a long time and I've never been able to say no to endurance events. The main difficulty was that I had spent the 3 months of the Summer in 3 different cities. In June I was in Los Angeles, in July Canberra (Australia) and in August Philadelphia. While running and swimming can be done everywhere this had made biking somewhat difficult and meant I hadn't ridden the bike I would be using for the last 2 months. Hence once I got back to Los Angeles in September, I had a week to reacquaint myself and make sure it was all running smoothly. </p>

            <p> There was a crew of seven of us who had been training and racing together for much of the past year, Jayden, Matias, Miles, Ryan, Stephanie, William, and Myself. We all had rather different levels of experience, from only starting triathlons this year to having run a double digit number of them. We also all have a mixture of different strengths and weaknesses, I very much rely on my run to bring me home and have have to minimise the damage on both the swim and bike legs as well as in transition. </p>

            <p> My goal was to try and complete the event in under 5 hours. To do this I had partitioned the time out into each sports and so was hoping the swim would take <40 min, the bike <2:50 hours and run <1:30. In total I would need to beat these goals by a combined 5-10 min to account for transition time. I was confident that I could beat each of these marks individually but, much less confident about how I would go in succession. This is one of the hardest parts of a triathlon, its one thing to run a half marathon, its quite another to do it immediately after a 90km bike ride. </p>

            <h3> Race Morning: </h3>

            <p> We woke up at 4:30am on Sunday in an eerie calm. Friday has been spent driving, for 6 hours up from Los Angeles with Saturday set aside to prepare and acclimatize. I had managed to keep nerves under control up until now but with only 2 and a half hours to go until the start time I could feel the tension rising. I usually don't eat breakfast before races but, given the length of the event, I decided to have a bowl of porridge with banana and honey along with a large mug of coffee. The house felt different to the days before, each one of us focusing inwards on what was to come. </p>

            <p> After breakfast, we jumped in the car and headed to the start line. As we drove the nerves only increased, once the horn blew we would be going for hard without break for 5 hours, and travelling 113km while we did it. We arrived around 5:30am and so had an hour to set up our transition area and make final preparations. This was the moment to layout the gear we wanted to take on each leg. It's also a good moment to use the toilet as it's hard to go on the course. As I left transition I grabbed 3 Energy Chew Blocks. My plan was to eat these just before the swim started to give some extra energy towards the end. </p>

            <p> We got to the beach just in time to have a quick dip in the water to check the temperature before grouping together to watch the pros start. At 6:30 sharp the pro men were off, followed by the women 10 minutes later. We funnelled into the the starting pen and, at 7am, the starting horn blew. Anticlimactically the group didn't move. That day, we were racing using a rolling start which meant that from the 7am start time, 4 people would start every 5 seconds until everyone had started. Thus, there was another 15 mins waiting in the line with nerves slowly building. Finally, after what had felt like forever, I reached the front of the line and was off! </p>

            <h3> Swim -- Elapsed Time: 0:00:00, Distance - 1.9km, Goal: - 40:00. </h3>

            <p> The swim was a lovely course out in the ocean swimming around the Santa Cruz Pier. Curiously, unlike the pros, most people don't immediately sprint for the water from the start line. This was a mistake I had no intention of making. Once I heard the beep I ran hard until it got deep enough that I was unable to run any further. My main goal with the swim was not to go out too hard. Unfortunately, as I would later realise, I had been far to conservative with my predicted swim time. I had joined the 35min group at the start line but, in the first 200m as I swum past swaths of people I realised that I should have been in a faster group. </p>

            <p> I was feeling good all the way out along the pier but could feel fatigue start to creep up as I approached the half way mark. The way back was tough but swimming towards a beach is useful mentally as you can keep your goal in sight. I also recognised Stephanie pass me with around 700m to go and so could focus on trying to stay on her feet for a 100m or so before she got too far ahead. The only struggle was in the last 400m as I could start to feel my legs cramping up. I managed to hold it off until the end of the swim but the moment I stood back up and started to run they gave way. Luckily, after a couple of steps they had loosened up again and I ran out of the water with a time of 32:53, far faster than I needed and feeling good for what was to come. </p>

            <h3> Transition 1 -- Elapsed Time: 0:32:53 </h3>

            <p> The Swim to Bike transition turned out to be quite a long transition in this case. There was about a 500m run to the transition zone which we would have to complete barefoot. Many athletes walked this section but I had no time to lose and so jogged it reasonably fast while trying to remove my wetsuit. Arriving in transition, I drank some gatorade to get the ocean taste out of my mouth, grabbed my bike, shoved a collection of bars and energy gels into my trisuit and took off. The bike is always the longest section of the triathlon and was going to be where I discovered how much I had improved from all my training. Overall, the transition took 5:58 so I was out on the bike course in under 40min as I'd hoped to be. </p>

            <h3> Bike -- Elapsed Time: 0:38:51, Distance - 90km, Goal 2:50:00 </h3>

            <p> I'd received some advice the day before on how to approach the bike ride which I decided to implement. Roughly, the ride was 5km of beautiful windy windy roads along the coast until we reached the highway and then 40km along the highway to the turnaround point before turning and doing it all in reverse. My plan, was to try and eat a bar in the first 5km and get my legs warmed up and then, once I got to the highway, settling in and trying to maintain a fast and consistent pace. Additionally, note that, you are not allowed to draft in half iron man and need to maintain at least 10m of separation between yourself and riders in front of you at all times. </p>

            <p> For better of worse though, thoughts of careful and consistent pacing went out the window when, 3km in, Miles passed me. In that moment I had 2 choices, let him go or try and hold him and so, ignoring what I'm assuming is the usual sound advice that you should focus on your own race, I decided to try and keep him in sight for a long as possible. Early on, Miles got a hundred meters or so lead on me but I managed to pull him back in and we spent the next 70km passing each other repeatedly. The course was beautiful though I wasn't paying to much attention as I was focused on not losing any ground. I could really tell how much I was losing by not having aero bars or helmet or any sort of fast wheels. I would pass people on every uphill and they would pass me back on every downhill. </p>

            <p> On the way out, I made an effort to grab a snack or some water on every uphill and over that first 45kms I ate 3 Energy Chew Blocks and 2 Cliff Bars. This was good but it left me with only 3 gels for the way back, not quite enough. I reached the turn around point almost 10 minutes ahead of schedule after riding for just over 75 min. I knew that if I could keep it up (and didn't blow up on the run) a great time was in sight. On the way back things start to get more difficult. I hadn't brought quite enough food and so had to ration them out over the 45km as my legs grew increasingly tired. I put in a large effort for about 10km trying to create some space from Miles but then, near the 70km mark he passed me and I couldn't keep up any more. The final 20kms were spent just trying to limit the damage and as I rolled into transition, I had ridden a 2:35:02. This was massively better than I had expected and put me in a great spot. </p>

            <h3> Transition 2 -- Elapsed Time: 3:13:53 </h3>

            <p> Coming to the second transition I was feeling physically a little awful but mentally great. I knew that if I could run what I hoped to run I would finish fast and with a great time. I dropped my bike and helmet, switched shoes drank half a bottle of Gatorade and headed out for the run. I had a slightly upset stomach but was confident that once I started running I would feel better. The transition took 2:36 and I was soon back out on the course. </p>

            <h3> Run -- Elapsed Time: 3:16:29, Distance 21.1 km, Goal 1:30:00 </h3>

            <p> My immediate goal was to try and catch Miles. In the last 20kms of the bike and the transition he had put around 3 or so minutes on me but I was confident that I could make up that ground if I ran well. Again, this was not the ideal race strategy and lead to me going out too hard, indeed I ran the first 5kms in less than 20min and passed Miles a little after the 6km mark. After this, I settled down slightly and focused on holding a slightly slower pace of around 4:15 min/km for the remainder. </p>

            <p> I'd given myself one gel to eat during the race but realised quickly that this was not enough. It would probably have worked if I was just running a Half-Marathon but my body was already quite fatigued and so a second gel would have been helpful. The middle section of the half marathon was tough but solid. I managed to hold my pace and was mentally counting down the remaining kilometres. Finally with around 5km's to go, things really started to hurt. I knew that, in order to beat 90 minutes for the full distance, I had 22 minutes to run the final 5kms. Unfortunately, I had started to get blisters on my toe and basically everything hurt. I put my head down and just focused on running smoothly and keeping my legs turning over. With about 2kms I could see the end in sight and ran past William which gave me a mild boost. The final 200m was a steep downhill back onto the beach where I had started and after 4 hours, 45 minutes and 37 seconds of solid exercise I sprinted past the finish line and collapsed. </p>

            <h2> Verdict: Would definitely do again! </h2>
