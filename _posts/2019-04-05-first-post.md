Given this is my first post here I thought I might write a little about myself. I am currently a first year Graduate student in Mathematics at CalTech (Californian Institute of Technology). While I am currently studying mathematics, I have a broad interest in a variety of fields including data science, physics and economics. In less academic matters I have a deep love of cooking and exercise (Mainly running), which I think complement each other nicely. Over time I hope to share much of what I work on an think about both inside and outside maths here, in a combination of blogs and other such posts.
