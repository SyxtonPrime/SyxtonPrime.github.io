So I've been very excited for the last couple of day due to the fact that I recently discovered that the work I completed in my hounours will be published as paper in the [Indiana University Mathematics Journal](https://www.iumj.indiana.edu/)!! I've been a little giddy so please excuse the mathematics below (And feel free to skip it).

I worked on a subset of the set of fusion categories known as the pointed fusion categories. These are well known as they are classified by a pair of a group and a three cocycle and have a close relation to mathematical physics. In particular I was working in the Drinfeld centre of these categories which also appears as the invariant of the circle in Dijkgraaf-Witten theory. These categories are known as modular tensor categories in part due to the fact that there is a powerful invariant of these categories known as the modular data which consists of a pair of categories (WHich form a projective representation of the modular group). As part of my honours I created code to compute these invariant for all Drinfeld centres of pointed fusion categories. Using this code I created a database of this modular data for all pointed fusion categoris with dimension less than 48, this database can be found [here](https://tqft.net/web/research/students/AngusGruen/).
