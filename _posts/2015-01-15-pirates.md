A little over a year ago I wrote a lengthy thesis on some work I did work I did in the Honours year of my undergraduate degree. The following will be a little technical and those of you who are not mathematically inclined sould feel free to skip to the end. At some point in the future I'll try and write up something explaining some of the basics of category theory. (Atleast some basics of the category theory I care about.)

I was looking at a particularly nice class of categories known as pointed fusion categories. Then, we apply a construction known as the Drinfeld center which takes in a pointed fusion categories an outputs a modular tensor category. One nice property of a modular tensor categories is that we can contruct some powerful invariants of it known as the modular data. These invariants are a pair of matrices and much of what is interesting about modular tensor categories can be computed from them. My goal as an undergraduate was to create a database of sets of modular data which could be searched through to look for patterns and other such things. Long story short, I ended up computing around 60Gb of matrices which can be found:
